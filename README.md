# SMIT Website Redesign (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial redesign of the SMIT website, conceptualized, designed, and developed by Grenish Rai. All the data presented on this website is publicly available from the original site, ensuring no private information is displayed.

## Purpose

The existing SMIT website is outdated and does not provide a user-friendly experience. Key elements essential for delivering a positive user experience are lacking, which significantly impacts the site's usability. Originally, our team was in discussions to take on this project; however, delays in receiving the final design resulted in the project being awarded elsewhere. In response, I took the initiative to redesign and develop the website independently, showcasing an improved, modern version that aligns with current web standards and user expectations.
