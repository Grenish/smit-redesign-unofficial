# SMIT Website Redesign (Unofficial)

This is an unofficial redesign of the SMIT website, conceptualized, designed, and developed by Grenish Rai. All the data presented on this website is publicly available from the original site, ensuring no private information is displayed.

## Purpose

The existing SMIT website is outdated and does not provide a user-friendly experience. Key elements essential for delivering a positive user experience are lacking, which significantly impacts the site's usability. Originally, our team was in discussions to take on this project; however, delays in receiving the final design resulted in the project being awarded elsewhere. In response, I took the initiative to redesign and develop the website independently, showcasing an improved, modern version that aligns with current web standards and user expectations.

## Tech Stack

To achieve a modern and efficient redesign, I have chosen the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: This React-based framework provides a powerful foundation for building dynamic and performant web applications. Its server-side rendering capabilities ensure fast load times and improved SEO, making it ideal for a high-traffic site like SMIT.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, allowing for rapid development with a focus on responsiveness and design consistency. It complements the component-driven architecture of Next.js, enabling scalable and maintainable design.

- **Node.js and Express.js**: These back-end technologies provide a robust and flexible server environment for handling API requests and serving dynamic content. Node.js's asynchronous nature ensures efficient handling of multiple requests, while Express.js offers a minimalist and flexible routing system.

- **PostgreSQL**: For managing publicly available data, PostgreSQL has been selected for its reliability, robustness, and ability to handle complex queries efficiently. Its relational database model ensures data integrity and scalability, essential for a project of this scope.

Together, these technologies form a cohesive and modern tech stack that supports the development of a fast, responsive, and user-friendly website.
